Compose your own beats, built with Web Audio API. 

This is an experiment inspired by Tone Matrix (http://tonematrix.audiotool.com) to learn more about what's available in the Web Audio API and how to manipulate sound. 

This will eventually become a tutorial for Women Who Code Sydney (July '14) and is still a work in progress.

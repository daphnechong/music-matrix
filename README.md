============

Compose your own beats, built with Web Audio API. 

This is an experiment inspired by Tone Matrix (http://tonematrix.audiotool.com) to learn more about what's available in the Web Audio API and how to manipulate sound. 

This became a [tutorial for Women Who Code Sydney](https://github.com/daphnechong/music-matrix-tutorial) in July 2014.
